        <p>I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows</p>
        <p>For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground</p>
        <p>I'm searching to behold the stories that are told</p>
        <p>When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned</p>
        <br> 
        <p>Tell you you're the greatest</p>
        <p>But once you turn they hate us</p>
        <br>
        <p> Oh, the misery</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
        <p>My enemy (look, look, look, look)</p>
        <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
        <p>But I'm ready</p>
        <br>
        <p>Your words up on the wall as you're praying for my fall</p> 
        <p>And the laughter in the halls and the names that I've been called</p>
        <p>I stack it in my mind and I'm waiting for the time</p> 
        <p>When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic</p>
        <br>
        <p>Tell you you're the greatest</p>
        <p>But once you turn, they hate us (huh)</p>
        <br>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Oh, the misery</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be</p>
        <p>My enemy (look, look, look, look)</p>
        <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
        <p>My enemy (look, look, look, look)</p>
        <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
        <p>Uh, look</p>
        <p> Okay, I'm hoping that somebody pray for me</p>
        <p>I'm praying that somebody hope for me</p>
        <p>I'm staying where nobody 'posed to be</p>
        <p>P-P-Posted, being a wreck of emotions</p>
        <p>Ready to go whenever, just let me know</p>
        <p>The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor</p>
        <p>The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable</p>
        <p>I'ma tell 'em hasta luego</p>
        <p>They wanna plot on my trot to the top</p>
        <p>I've been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut</p>
        <p>I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe</p>
        <p>And it matters more because I had it not</p>
        <p>Had I thought about wreaking havoc on an opposition</p>
        <p>Kinda shocking they wanted static with precision, I'm automatic</p>
        <p>Quarterback, I ain't talkin' sacking</p>
        <p>Pack it, pack it up, I don't panic</p>
        <p>Batter, batter up, who the baddest?</p>
        <p>It don't matter 'cause we at your throat</p>
        <br>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be</p>
        <p>My enemy</p>
        <br>
        <p>Oh, the misery</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
        <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
        <br>
        <p>Pray it away, I swear</p>
        <p>I'll never be a saint, no way</p>
        <p>My enemy</p>
        <p>Pray it away, I swear</p>
        <p>I'll never be a saint</p>
