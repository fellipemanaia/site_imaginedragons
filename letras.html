        <p>I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows</p>
        <p>For my mind to run around with my ear up to the ground</p>
        <p>I'm searching to behold the stories that are told</p>
        <p>When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned</p>
        
        
            <p>Tell you you're the greatest</p>
            <p>But once you turn they hate us</p>
            <p> Oh, the misery</p>
            <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
            <p>Spare the sympathy</p>
            <p>Everybody wants to be my enemy</p>
            <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
            <p>My enemy (look, look, look, look)</p>
            <p>(Look out for yourself)</p>
            <p>But I'm ready</p>
